  <h1>What is the difference between id and class hooks?</h1>

  <p class="a">
    IDs should be unique, used for only one element
  </p>

  <p class="a">
    Classes can (should) be used for manu
  </p>

  <p class="a">
    Each of these paragraphs is in the 'a' class
  </p>

  <p class="a center">
    But this one also is also in the 'center' class. You can pile on
    attributes with class. Pretty neat.
  </p>

  <p class="a center" id="footer">
    Something like a footer, that only appears once, should use an id.
  </p>

  <p>The id is important to the browser, e.g. 'www.mysite.com#some_id' will
  jumpt to the element 'some_id'</p>
