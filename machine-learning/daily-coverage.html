          Continuing finding the error criteria. training MSE. Now we want to
          talk about, well, probably test MSE.

           What is the cost of adding parameters to a model? More degrees of
           freedom.

          Want to avoid variability in the method. Variance and bias:
          mathematical definitions. There is a relationship between MSE, bias,
          and variance; you can get it by using the relation
          $Var(\hat{m}(x))=Var(\hat{m}(x)-m(x))$

        </p>

        For classification, there is a single best estimator, the Bayes
        estimator. But it can't be used because there are unknown parameters.
        There is a naive bayes classifier that is tries to estimate them.

          How to measure goodness of fit, mean sum of squares. Why square the residuals? Makes the math easier.
