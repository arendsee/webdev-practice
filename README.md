A forray into Python Flask dev

I will loosely follow Miguel Grinberg's (MG) mega tutorial, at least initially.

To start, I need to get the Flash (see MG)

``` bash
python -m venv flask
```

This command creates a local version of the python interpreter.

Now install flask and all necessary extensions, see Makefile
