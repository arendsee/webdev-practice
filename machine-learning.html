  <h1>The point</h1>

    <p>
      The point of this page, and the links below it, are twofold. I am taking
      a machine learning class, and need to take notes. I also want to study
      web development.
    </p>

    <div class="def"> 
    <p>
      Given training data, find f such that

      <div class="equation def" lang="latex">\hat{Y} \approx f(X)</div>
    </p>

      If the training data are paired X and Y values, then you may do
      supervised learning. If you have only X, then you are limited to
      unsupervised learning (basically clustering).
